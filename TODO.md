## TO DO


- [ ] change annotate_oncoKB to work with gene.index -- hgnc.symbol, use merge w/hgnc.symbol
- [ ] same as above with depmap hgnc.symbol, use merge w/hgnc.symbol
- [ ] generalize to add annotations to gene.index again, hgnc.symbol, use merge w/hgnc.symbol
- [ ] Integrate with kegg pathway views, need entrez ID genes for this
- [ ] Document functions
- [ ] Integrate CORE
- [ ] debug scclust integration
- [ ] make a function for calling amplification and deletions on buildDNA -- Bastien
- [ ] build functions for spatial analysis, need 2d and 3d f(x)
- [x] Integrate scclust
