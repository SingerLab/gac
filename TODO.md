## TO DO

- [ ] Integrate CORE
- [ ] build functions for spatial analysis, need 2d and 3d f(x)
- [ ] generalize to add annotations to gene.index again, hgnc.symbol, use merge w/hgnc.symbol

## done

- [x] change annotate_oncoKB to work with gene.index -- hgnc.symbol, use merge w/hgnc.symbol
- [x] same as above with depmap hgnc.symbol, use merge w/hgnc.symbol
- [x] Integrate with kegg pathway views, need entrez ID genes for this
- [X] Document functions
- [x] debug scclust integration
- [x] make a function for calling amplification and deletions on buildDNA -- Bastien
- [x] Integrate scclust
