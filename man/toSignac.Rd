\title{toSignac: the open-source simple integrated analysis of cells/copynumber}
\source{
\url{https://github.com/SingerLab/toSignac}
}
\description{
toSignac is an open-source framework and toolkit for managing genome wide copy
number data.  It provides a set of standard matrices that are symultaneously
manipulated by various functions to maintain syncronized bin, gene, annotation,
and qc information from a single-cell DNA sequencing experiment as same-cell
G+T.  Efforts will be made to add support for log-ratios for the analysis of
bulk DNA data.
}
\details{
toSignac is actively being developed and is currently in ALPHA pre-release.
My hope is that others will find this helpful for their copy number needs,
and share new methods.

The HeatmapCNR function in toSignac implements Bray-Curtis disimilarity on
ComplexHeatmap as the default method to estimate cell-cell distances and
generate the heatmaps.
