\title{build binary matrix from integer copy number data}
\usage{
binary.X(X, base.ploidy = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a copy number matrix to convert to an incidence matrix}

\item{base.ploidy}{expected cell ploidy, e.g. 2N = 2, 4N = 4}
}
\value{
Returns an incidence matrix for X, when X != base.ploidy
}
\description{
This function builds a binary, incidence, matrix from the cnr$X.  It was designed as a helper function to generate the input for infSCITE.
}
\details{
Because infSCITE was developed for mutation data, this function creates a precense/absence matrix of the data

By default, anything not diploid is 1.
}
\examples{

data(cnr)

Z <- binary.X(cnr$genes[, c("CDK4", "MDM2")])

}
