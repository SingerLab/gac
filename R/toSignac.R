#' toSignac: Sinple integrated analysis of cells/copynumber
#'
#'
#' Pronouced: t o Signac , as in the open-source Signac
#'
#'
#' toSignac is an open-source framework and toolkit for managing genome wide copy number data.  It provides a set of standard matrices that are symultaneously manipulated by various functions to maintain syncronized bin, gene, annotation, and qc information from a single-cell DNA sequencing experiment as same-cell G+T.  Efforts will be made to add support for log-ratios for the analysis of bulk DNA data.
#'
#' 
#' toSignac is actively being developed and is currently in ALPHA pre-release.  My hope is that others will find this helpful for their copy number needs, and share new methods.
#'
#' The HeatmapCNR function in toSignac implements Bray-Curtis disimilarity on ComplexHeatmap as the default method to estimate cell-cell distances and generate the heatmaps
